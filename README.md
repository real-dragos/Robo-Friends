# ROBO Friends

It is a React & Redux web application that serves as my first interaction with these technologies. The application is pretty simple, but contains all the components needed for a beginner to be able to create web applications using React and to approach more complex topics. Also, it uses a pretty funny and nice web service called [RoboHash](https://robohash.org).

## Available Scripts

### `npm install`

Run this command after cloning the repository in order to install all the modules/dependencies that the application uses.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
